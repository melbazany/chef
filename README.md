# "Forkify" - Recipe Website Search Tool

<a href="https://recipes-by-mel.netlify.app/">Forkify app<a/>

This app searches a variety of recipe databases to allow users to search for recipes,
add custom recipes, and bookmark their favorites.

I used this as a practice project to learn the MVC framework and refresh
my vanilla JS skills to further enhance my success in my progress to learn React.
